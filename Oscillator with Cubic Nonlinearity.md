# Simplified Solution: Oscillator with Mixed Nonlinear Terms (x·ẋ)

Consider the equation: 
ẍ + ω₀²x + εxẋ = F₀cos(Ωt)

This includes a mixed nonlinear term (x·ẋ) which is common in systems with nonlinear damping.

## Step 1: Expand the solution as a power series in ε
x(t) = x₀(t) + εx₁(t) + ε²x₂(t) + ...

## Step 2: Substitute the expansion into the original equation
ẍ₀ + εẍ₁ + ... + ω₀²(x₀ + εx₁ + ...) + ε(x₀ + εx₁ + ...)(ẋ₀ + εẋ₁ + ...) = F₀cos(Ωt)

## Step 3: Expand the nonlinear term
xẋ = (x₀ + εx₁ + ...)(ẋ₀ + εẋ₁ + ...) = x₀ẋ₀ + ε(x₀ẋ₁ + x₁ẋ₀) + O(ε²)

## Step 4: Collect terms by powers of ε
(ẍ₀ + ω₀²x₀ - F₀cos(Ωt)) + ε(ẍ₁ + ω₀²x₁ + x₀ẋ₀) + O(ε²) = 0

## Step 5: Set each coefficient of ε^n to zero
Order ε⁰ equation: 
ẍ₀ + ω₀²x₀ = F₀cos(Ωt)

Order ε¹ equation: 
ẍ₁ + ω₀²x₁ = -x₀ẋ₀

## Step 6: Solve the order ε⁰ equation using only the particular solution
For the forced harmonic oscillator, we'll use just the particular solution:

x₀(t) = F₀cos(Ωt)/(ω₀² - Ω²)

Let D = F₀/(ω₀² - Ω²) for brevity: 
x₀(t) = D·cos(Ωt)

## Step 7: Compute ẋ₀(t)
ẋ₀(t) = -D·Ω·sin(Ωt)

## Step 8: Calculate x₀(t)·ẋ₀(t) for the order ε¹ equation
x₀(t)·ẋ₀(t) = D·cos(Ωt)·(-D·Ω·sin(Ωt)) = -D²·Ω·cos(Ωt)·sin(Ωt)

Using the trigonometric identity: cos(a)·sin(a) = sin(2a)/2

x₀(t)·ẋ₀(t) = -D²·Ω·sin(2Ωt)/2

## Step 9: Solve the order ε¹ equation
ẍ₁ + ω₀²x₁ = -x₀ẋ₀ = D²·Ω·sin(2Ωt)/2

For a forcing term of the form sin(2Ωt), the particular solution has the form:
x₁ₚ(t) = C·sin(2Ωt)

Substituting into the differential equation:
-4Ω²C·sin(2Ωt) + ω₀²C·sin(2Ωt) = D²·Ω·sin(2Ωt)/2

Equating coefficients:
C(ω₀² - 4Ω²) = D²·Ω/2

Therefore:
C = D²·Ω / (2(ω₀² - 4Ω²))

And:
x₁ₚ(t) = D²·Ω·sin(2Ωt) / (2(ω₀² - 4Ω²))

Substituting D = F₀/(ω₀² - Ω²):
x₁ₚ(t) = F₀²·Ω·sin(2Ωt) / (2(ω₀² - Ω²)²(ω₀² - 4Ω²))

## Step 10: Final approximate solution
x(t) ≈ x₀(t) + εx₁(t)
    = F₀·cos(Ωt)/(ω₀² - Ω²) + ε·F₀²·Ω·sin(2Ωt)/(2(ω₀² - Ω²)²(ω₀² - 4Ω²))

This gives us a simplified approximate solution to order ε, valid for the steady-state response when:
1. Ω ≠ ω₀ (to avoid primary resonance)
2. Ω ≠ ω₀/2 (to avoid secondary resonance)

The solution shows that the nonlinear term generates a frequency component at 2Ω (twice the forcing frequency), which is a characteristic feature of nonlinear systems.
